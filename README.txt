In the folders above are some of the relevant projects I've completed during my engineering coursework. Projects are separated according to the class in which they were completed. Class folders with the AERO-XXXX in front of the class name are courses from my undergraduate degree at Auburn University while classes with AEROSP-XXX are courses taken during my masters at the University of Michigan. 

Unless stated otherwise, all codes are authored by myself. 

AERO-4720 Senior Design 2: 
For this class, myself and 4 others did a detailed design of an orbital class rocket designed to take 75 metric tons of payload to an orbit of 800 km. 

In my group, I was responsible for the propulsion case study to decide on the engines, the CFD analysis of the vehicle at max-q, the aero analysis of the vehicle (including center of pressure calculations), the 3-DOF simulation of the launch, and the flight termination system. I also assisted in sizing the vehicle and creating the CAD model. 

Included in this folder is the final report created by the group, the 3-DOF simulation of the vehicles launch, and the atmospheric model developed for the 3-DOF. 


AEROSP-530 Gas Turbine Propulsion:
For this class, we were tasked with modifying an existing engine (which was given to us) to meet the requirements for a new vehicle. These included new constraints on the size and the thrust output of the engine. This was an individual project so all work is solely mine. 

Included in this folder is the report detailing the detailed cycle and component analysis and design in addition to the MATLAB code used to perform the cycle analysis on the engine. 


AEROSP-535 Rocket Propulsion:
For this class, our final project consisted of designing a launch vehicle capable of lifting 120 metric tons into a 400 km orbit. This included selecting propellants; designing the rocket engine and peforming CEA analysis on it to determine Isp, thrust, etc.; designing a launch vehicle around the designed engines and propellant; and simulating its launch into orbit. 

I was responsible for the simulation of the vehicles launch as well as assisting in the sizing of the vehicle. We collectively made a group decision on which propellants we thought would be best for the respective stages. 

Included in this folder is our final report detailing the entire process as well as our results, the 3-DOF simulation to orbit, and the code used to size the rocket.
